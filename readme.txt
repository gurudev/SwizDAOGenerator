In case you are running into errors:
You need to ensure you copy the following plugins:
Copy to [eclipse-directory]/plugins

    * BSF - http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/downloads_bsf.cgi
    * Rhino - http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html

After you add the jars you will need to do the following step:

Flash Builder>Preferences>Ant>Runtime>Classpath,
�Ant Home Entries� > �Add External JARs� - point to jar files for:

    * bsf
    * rhino
    * org.apache.commons.logging._[ver].jar (which should already be in your Eclipse plugins directory)
